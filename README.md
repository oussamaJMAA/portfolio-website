# Streamlit Portfolio & Chatbot

Welcome to my personal portfolio website crafted with Streamlit and enhanced with an interactive chatbot feature using Langchain. This site showcases my professional journey, skills, projects, and educational background. The integrated chatbot serves as your guide, ready to answer questions about my experience and expertise.

## Features

- **Interactive Streamlit Interface**: The website has an intuitive, user-friendly interface, built with Streamlit, enabling easy navigation through the different sections.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Engage with an intelligent chatbot powered by Langchain, which is programmed to provide detailed answers about my professional qualifications and experiences.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible and consistent viewing experience across a wide range of devices.

## How It Works

### Streamlit Web Interface

Streamlit is an open-source app framework designed for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. It allows for the creation of web apps with ease using Python scripts. This website presents information sections including:

- About Me
- My Skillset
- Projects Portfolio
- Education and Certifications
- Contact Information

To navigate the full site, simply use the sidebar menu generated by Streamlit.

### Chatbot Integration

The chatbot developed with Langchain offers an interactive element where you – as a recruiter or interested party – can inquire about specific details of my career. For example, ask "Tell me about your work with Python," or "What projects have you completed using React?"
